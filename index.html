        <p>
            This specification describes Blockchain Links (Blinks) as a method for
            referencing blockchain-based data such as transactions and blocks.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Referencing data in a Blockchain or DLT is useful for a variety of
            use cases and applications. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Web-based blockchain explorers, especially those supporting multiple chains.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blockchain API's.
            </li>
            <li>
                Validating timestamps across chains.
            </li>
            <li>
                Checking additional transaction data for smart contracts or data hashes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Looking up a specific block.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Existing methods of referencing Blockchain data are typically specific to a
            single Blockchain or a few similar ones in a JSON-based structure, such as
            <a href="https://chainpoint.org">Chainpoint</a>. Defining a specification
            for Blinks in a URI format allow it to be used in schema fields that were
            previously restricted to URI's/URN's as well as opening it up for a variety
            of encoding mechanisms (such as Concise Binary Object Representation [[RFC7049]]).
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
            The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
            referencing of Blockchain Links.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><dfn data-lt="blockchains|blockchain technology">blockchain</dfn></dt>
            <dd>

                entries in blocks of transactions, which are grouped together and hashed into a
                cryptographic chain. Because this type of <a>DLT</a> was introduced by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, the term
                <em>blockchain</em> is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Bitcoin
                ledger.

                to maintain a shared ledger in which each transaction is cryptographically
                signed and chained to the previous transaction.

        <h2>Blockchain Links Specification</h2>

        <p>
            A Blink MUST adhere to a minimal set of base <a>Blink scheme</a> requirements in order to be a valid.
            In order to be used with a specific <a>DLT</a>, a <a>Blink chain</a> specification can be implemented to
            extend the Blink scheme. The Blink specification makes suggestions but does not make requirements or enforcements
            around how a specific chain is implemented or which chain specification shall be used if multiple are created.
        </p>

        <div class="issue">Consider a registry that can be used to find existing chain specifications.</div>

        <section>
            <h3>Blink Syntax</h3>

            <p>
                The generic <a>Blink scheme</a> is a URI scheme conformant with [[RFC3986]].
            </p>

            <p>
                The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[RFC5234]],
                which defines ALPHA and DIGIT. All other rule names not defined in
                this ABNF are defined in [[RFC3986]].
            </p>

            <pre class="nohighlight">
                blink          = "blink:" chain-name ":" chain-network ":" chain-asset-id
                chain-name     = 1*chain-char
                chain-network  = 1*chain-char
                chain-char     = %x61-7A / DIGIT
                chain-asset-id = *( ":" *idchar ) 1*idchar
                idchar         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
            </pre>

            <div class="issue">Verify that this ABNF definition is the expectation and inclusive enough for all chains.</div>

                    <a>chain-name</a>. <code>chain-asset-id</code> SHALL be well defined by
                    a specific <a>Blink chain</a> specification in order to reference available
                    assets. Assets MAY include <a>blocks</a>, <a>transactions</a>, <a>smart contracts</a>,
                    or other available assets depending on the <a>DLT</a>. The necessary information
                    needed to look up a given asset MAY include multiple asset ID's, as seperated by
                    a <code>:</code>. A possible example includes <code>abc123:321cba</code> if looking
                    up transaction <code>321cba</code> on block <code>abc123</code>.
